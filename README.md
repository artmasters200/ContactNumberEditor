# ContactType Changer (Android App)

This project changes the phone contact type into custom text:
* it displays the original text with network carrier (ex. Globe, Smart or Sun)
* This does not change *yet* the contact number formatting (future version)

For now, the lookup criteria is as follow:
* Carrier related to Globe, Smart, TM, Sun & TNT carrier
* Contacts that is saved to Contact Database
* Some related Contacts Sync/ Association (i.e. Skype data) does not change (could be it is not saved to Contacts DB)

Future releases:
* Sorted Names or Number or Carrier
* Search by Name or Number
* Contact Number formatting
